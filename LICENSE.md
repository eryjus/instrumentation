# License

I normally copyright my own code under a Beerware License.  However, since the Bochs license is more strict that I use, I have to maintain their license.  Therefore: 

## Bochs license

The following points clarify the Bochs license:

1) Bochs as a whole is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License

2) Parts of Bochs have specific licenses which are compatible with the
   GNU Lesser General Public License. Hence each source file contains its
   own licensing information.

However, if you can concretely identify any of my own contributions to this code that do not conflict with the above copyright (good luck with that!), please consider them as:
